 * Start doing unit tests = http://qunitjs.com/
 * download page - allow user to assemble minified thing from component parts
 * remove dependencies from the project and make them get sucked in some other way
 * RSS feed on site
 * Resize event
   * callback on all entities
   * look at Nick's resize code http://onetwenty.org/upload/soupbox/
   * re-jig the canvas size to make it still fit it's container

old notes
---------

* move lineOnLine and pointInPoly out of the global namespace
* test multiplayer demo with all three browsers at the same time for a while
* put json2.js fetch into the documentation generation Makefile externals
* update FallingGame with audio
* update AsteroidsTNG with audio

* in internet explorer, "caller" is not defined perhaps - check multiplayer code & grep for others

* nesters.js - child and parent heirarchies
* Wojtek/vibrant's "canvas passthrough" camera method for a camera.js class

* resize code from "Lynx" on tigsource:

    // When the window is resized, expand the canvas to fit
    var resizeHandler = function(ev) {
      var canvas = gs.canvas;
      var width = window.innerWidth;
      var height = window.innerHeight;
      canvas.width = width;
      canvas.height = height;
      canvas.style.width = width;
      canvas.style.height = height;
      gs.width = width;
      gs.height = height;
    }
    if (window.addEventListener) {
      window.addEventListener('resize', resizeHandler, false);
    } else if (document.body.attachEvent) {
      document.body.attachEvent('onresize', resizeHandler);
    } else if(document.body.onresize) {
      document.body.onresize = resizeHandler;
    }

* on addEntity() add methods to the object
  * addEntity() method for objects to nest objects?
    * canvas coordinate passhthrough optionally?
  * set_priority() method for updating priority of an object?

* tutorial with:
 * progress bars
 * sprites
 * vectors
 * audio
 * keyboard/pointer input
 * collisions

* multiplayer server + examples + documentation

* finish tmxmap stuff + demo

* method to add a whole array of new entities
* method to erase a whole array of entities

* make a method to get actual framerate
* menu.js - creates a nice full-screen text menu
* piemenu.js - creates a piemenu
* use twinhelix pngfix on site
* external library demo links direct in readme
* extend canvas with useful methods (like drawlines)
* double buffering
  * http://www.felinesoft.com/blog/index.php/2010/09/accelerated-game-programming-with-html5-and-canvas/
  * FlashCanvas works fastest from inside same canvas - double canvas width and buffer from left-to-right

* try and get audio onload working on all platforms
* fix internet explorer offset bug
